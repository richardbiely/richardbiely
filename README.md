Hi everyone :)

I am a former senior programmer at [Bohemia Interactive](https://www.bohemia.net/), where I was responsible for the Arma series. My main focus was on behind-the-scenes and low-level systems, optimization, networking and security. Prior to that, I worked at [CGC a.s](https://cgc.sk/) as an integrator of various business-level security devices into a custom integrated security system SBI.

I am also the author of [Gaia-ECS](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs), a powerful entity component system written in C++. This framework can be used to elevate any project, big or small, in the gaming or business applications industry. Built on the principles of data-oriented designed, Gaia-ECS aims to provide a simple and streamlined framework that allows you to realise your ideas while keeping your projects easy to maintain and performant. You can also use it as a great learning experience.

At some point, I become interested in voxel, which led me to create [Voxe(lmetric)](https://github.com/richardbiely/Voxelmetric) and a few more currently private projects.

I would like to thank everybody who decided to support my projects and their communities. Your help or advice are greatly appreciated and can influence their future. You rock!
