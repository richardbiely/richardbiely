Hi everyone :)

I am a former [Bohemia Interactive](https://www.bohemia.net) senior programmer responsible for the Arma series where I did mostly work on behind-the-scenes low-level systems, optimization, networking and security. Before that I used to work as an integrator of various business-level security devices into a custom integrated security system SBI at [CGC a.s](https://cgc.sk).

I am also the author of [Gaia-ECS](https://github.com/richardbiely/gaia-ecs), a powerful entity component system written in C++. You can use the framework to elevate any kind of project, be it games or business applications. Scope or size do not really matter.
The project is build with the idea in mind to provide you with a framework that can help you realise your ideas in a simple and streamlined way. At the same time, it aims to keep your project easy to maintain while keeping its performance in check. You can also use it as a great learning experience.

At some point I grow fond of voxels which resulted in creation of [Voxe(lmetric)](https://github.com/richardbiely/Voxelmetric) and a few more currently private projects.

Thank you everybody who decided to support the projects and their community. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated and can influence their future. You rock!
